# Reflection

## Estimates
All of my estimate were longer than my actual time. It eventually improves. 
Not because my estimates became more accurate, but because later projects took more time to finish

## Reviews
I see how people solve the same problems differently.
Being reviewed also taught me better version control as I had more commits later in the semester.

## Practicals
Making sure assignment deadline did not surpass future weeks lectures and lessons too much.
Doing this may make students apply their current lessons to this assignment when this is not allowed.
